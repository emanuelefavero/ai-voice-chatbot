# Appointments and Visits

Appointments are recommended for all visits.

How to book:

Same-day appointments may be available depending on availability.

Walk-in visits are accepted for urgent cases, but scheduled appointments are always prioritized.

If you need to cancel or reschedule, please notify us at least 24 hours in advance.
