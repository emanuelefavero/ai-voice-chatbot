Prescription medications are available only for pets that are current patients of RoyalPaws Veterinary Clinic.

Medication refills:

- Refills can be requested by phone during opening hours
- Some medications require a recent examination before refill approval

We do not dispense human medications or medications prescribed by other clinics.

Prescription requests are typically processed within 24 hours.
